If there is already a good master bias and master flats, and you're only interested in V band observations, then running:

    ./reduce.sh YYYY-MM-DD

Will create (or re-make) a folder under .../tgp/Cepheids1/ReducedData full of the reduced frames, normalised to an exposure time of 1s.

If not:

Create a master bias for a date by using the bash script bash_from_date.sh as follows `./bash_from_date.sh DATE`

Create a master flat by copying all valid flats to Flats by using ./copy_valid_flats.sh, then calling master_flats.py on this.

Then call reduce.py on a file of raw images, with the correct bias and flat field. This will generate all the reduced images.
We will still need to go through by hand and delete any with blurring, but luckily this shouldn't take too long using something like ds9/gaia,
as the files are sorted by time so if the most recent images are okay, we can delete all the rest without needing to check.

In future observations we shouldnt have many repeats and I'm aiming to take better notes.

There are a few bash scripts and python files knocking about, I know it's not the neatest but it's flexible.

You can look in MasterTests and run biases_similar.py to see that over time, the biases are all the same within noise, so pick any date.

The Flats are valid for 20 Days, we're making observations from the 27th of September to the 21st of October

dates 27 28 29 30  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
ttus*  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
ttus*                 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

*ttus = Time 'Til UnStable, how long a flat field is good for.

As long as we take flats from the second of october to the 16th of october,
there shouldnt be any change so we can stack them from different nights to get a better master.
